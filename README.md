# ML-SPARK-CASE-STUDY

This repository contains my final-round submission for ML Spark, a flagship machine learning competition held as part of TVASTR'25 â€“ The Analytics Fest, organized by the Analytics Club at the School of Management Studies, University of Hyderabad. The competition challenged participants to solve real-world problems using machine learning and data analytics.

Domain Overview:
In the competitive financial landscape, banks and financial institutions must adopt innovative approaches to effectively target and engage their customers. Traditional marketing campaigns often result in low conversion rates due to inefficient targeting. Leveraging machine learning techniques can significantly enhance these efforts by predicting which customers are most likely to respond positively to marketing campaigns.
